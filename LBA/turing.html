            <p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>
            <p>Some weeks ago you paid us the honour of a visit, and we believe that you
                regard our work as important. You will have seen that, thanks largely to the
                energy and foresight of Commander Travis, we have been well supplied with the
                ‘bombes’ for the breaking of the German Enigma codes. We think, however, that
                you ought to know that this work is being held up, and in some cases is not being
                done at all, principally because we cannot get suYcient staff to deal with it. Our
                reason for writing to you direct is that for months we have done everything that
                we possibly can through the normal channels, and that we despair of any early
                improvement without your intervention. No doubt in the long run these par- ticular requirements will be
                met, but meanwhile still more precious months will have been wasted, and as our needs are continually expanding we see little hope
                of ever being adequately staffed.</p>

            <p>We realise that there is a tremendous demand for labour of all kinds and that
                its allocation is a matter of priorities. The trouble to our mind is that as we are a
                very small section with numerically trivial requirements it is very diYcult to
                bring home to the authorities Wnally responsible either the importance of what is
                done here or the urgent necessity of dealing promptly with our requests. At the
                same time we Wnd it hard to believe that it is really impossible to produce quickly
                the additional staff that we need, even if this meant interfering with the normal
                machinery of allocations.</p>
            <p>We do not wish to burden you with a detailed list of our diYculties, but the
                following are the bottlenecks which are causing us the most acute anxiety.</p>

            <h2>
                1. Breaking of Naval Enigma (Hut 8)
            </h2>
            <p>Owing to shortage of staff and the overworking of his present team the Hollerith
                section here under Mr Freeborn has had to stop working night shifts. The effect
                of this is that the Wnding of the naval keys is being delayed at least twelve hours
                every day. In order to enable him to start night shifts again Freeborn needs
                immediately about twenty more untrained Grade III women clerks. To put
                himself in a really adequate position to deal with any likely demands he will
                want a good many more.</p>
            <p>A further serious danger now threatening us is that some of the skilled male
                staff, both with the British Tabulating Company at Letchworth and in Freeborn’s
                section here, who have so far been exempt from military service, are now liable to
                be called up.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Military and Air Force Enigma (Hut 6)</h2>

            <p>We are intercepting quite a substantial proportion of wireless traYc in the
                Middle East which cannot be picked up by our intercepting stations here. This
                contains among other things a good deal of new ‘Light Blue’ intelligence. Owing
                to shortage of trained typists, however, and the fatigue of our present decoding staV, we cannot get all
                this
                traYc
                decoded. This has been the state of affairs
                since May. Yet all that we need to put matters right is about twenty trained
                typists.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Bombe testing, Hut 6 and Hut 8</h2>
            <p>In July we were promised that the testing of the ‘stories’ produced by the bombes
                would be taken over by the WRNS in the bombe hut and that suYcient WRNS
                would be provided for this purpose. It is now late in October and nothing
                has been done. We do not wish to stress this so strongly as the two preceding
                points, because it has not actually delayed us in delivering the goods. It has,
                however, meant that staff in Huts 6 and 8 who are needed for other jobs have
                had to do the testing themselves. We cannot help feeling that with a Service
                matter of this kind it should have been possible to detail a body of WRNS for
                this purpose, if suYciently urgent instructions had been sent to the right
                quarters.</p>

        <section class="inline-heading">
            <h2>4.</h2>
            <p>Apart altogether from staff matters, there are a number of other directions
                in which it seems to us that we have met with unnecessary impediments. It
                would take too long to set these out in full, and we realise that some of the
                matters involved are controversial. The cumulative effect, however, has been to
                drive us to the conviction that the importance of the work is not being impressed
                with suYcient force upon those outside authorities with whom we have to
                deal.</p>
            <p>
                We have written this letter entirely on our own initiative. We do not know
                who or what is responsible for our diffculties, and most emphatically we do
                not want to be taken as criticising Commander Travis who has all along done
                his utmost to help us in every possible way. But if we are to do our job as well
                as it could and should be done it is absolutely vital that our wants, small as they
                are, should be promptly attended to. We have felt that we should be failing in
                our duty if we did not draw your attention to the facts and to the effects which
                they are having and must continue to have on our work, unless immediate action
                is taken.
